## Race Condition
When the result of multiple threads executing a critical section may differ depending on the sequence in which the threads execute, the critical section is said to contain a race condition.\
The term race condition stems from the metaphor that the threads are racing through the critical section, and that the result of that race impacts the result of executing the critical section.

## Liveness
A concurrent application's ability to execute in a timely manner is known as its liveness. The most common kind of liveness problem, **deadlock**, and  two other liveness problems, **starvation and livelock**.


### Deadlock
Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other.

### Starvation
Starvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to make progress. This happens when shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by "greedy" threads. For example, suppose an object provides a synchronized method that often takes a long time to return. If one thread invokes this method frequently, other threads that also need frequent synchronized access to the same object will often be blocked.

### Livelock
A thread often acts in response to the action of another thread. If the other thread's action is also a response to the action of another thread, then livelock may result. As with deadlock, livelocked threads are unable to make further progress. However, the threads are not blocked â€” they are simply too busy responding to each other to resume work.

## Happens-Before Relation (volatile, atomic variables, Concurrent Collections) (Changes made to var is guaranteed to be visible to other thread) 
* Java defines the happens-before relation on memory operations such as reads and writes of shared variables. 
* The results of a write by one thread are guaranteed to be visible to a read by another thread only if the write operation happens-before the read operation. 
* The synchronized and volatile constructs can form happens-before relationships.
* A write to a volatile field happens-before every subsequent read of that same field. Writes and reads of volatile fields have similar memory consistency effects as entering and exiting monitors, but do not entail mutual exclusion locking.
